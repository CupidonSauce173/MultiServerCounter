# MultiServerCounter
A PocketMine-MP plugin that combines online players counts of multiple servers.

*Latest development phars: https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/luca28pet/MultiServerCounter/MultiServerCounter*

This is useful e.g. when you have a lobby server and other gamemodes on different servers, and you want the lobby server to display  the number of players of all the servers, combined, when queried from a server list or the menu in the MCBE client.

**How to use:**
- Drop the phar in the plugins folder
- Restart the server
- Edit the config.yml found in plugins_data/MultiServerCounter and add the server you want to query
- Save the file and restart the server

**config.yml**
